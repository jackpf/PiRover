## Configuring PiRover

These instructions assume you have a PiRover with firmware built and installed on it.

To instruct your PiRover to connect to a wireless network:
* Plug the SD card into a computer (currently only Linux or OS X are supported)
* Navigate to the SD card root in your file browser
* Open up the program called "wifi"
* Follow the instructions
* Eject your SD card and plug it back into your PiRover
* Turn it on, when the green LED starts flashing rapidly you are connected to a network!

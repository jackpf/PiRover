## Building the Android app:

You can either build the android app with gradle:

```
cd PiRover/app/Android
./gradlew build
```

And the generated APKs will be in app/build/outputs/apk.

Or you can install Android Studio from [https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) and import the project.
